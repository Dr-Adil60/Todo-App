## ***To-Do App***
This is a basic to-do app created using HTML and JavaScript. The app allows users to add and delete tasks. The functionality is built using event listeners and query selectors. There is no backend or database connected, so the data will reset when the page is refreshed.

## ***Features***
Add a task: Users can add tasks to the to-do list by entering text and clicking the "Add" button.
Delete a task: Each task in the list has a delete button that allows users to remove it from the list.
No data persistence: The to-do list is not saved in any database, so tasks will be cleared when the page is refreshed.
